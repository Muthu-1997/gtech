            tree is a perennial plant with an elongated stem, or trunk, supporting branches and leaves in most species. In some usages, the definition of a tree may be narrower, including only woody plants with secondary growth, plants that are usable as lumber or
            plants above a specified height. Trees are not a taxonomic group but include a variety of plant species that have independently evolved a woody trunk and branches as a way to tower above other plants to compete for sunlight. Trees tend to
            be long-lived, some reaching several thousand years old. In wider definitions, the taller palms, tree ferns, bananas, and bamboos are also trees. Trees have been in existence for 370 million years. It is estimated that there are just over
            3 trillion mature trees in the world.

            Trees play a significant role in reducing erosion and moderating the climate. They remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and store large quantities of carbon in their tissues. Trees and forests provide a habitat for many species of animals and plants.
            Tropical rainforests are among the most biodiverse habitats in the world. Trees provide shade and shelter, timber for construction, fuel for cooking and heating, and fruit for food as well as having many other uses. In parts of the world,
            forests are shrinking as trees are cleared to increase the amount of land available for agriculture. Because of their longevity and usefulness, trees have always been revered, with sacred groves in various cultures, and they play a role in
            many of the world's mythologies

            A tree is a tall plant with a trunk and branches made of wood. Trees can live for many years. The oldest tree ever discovered is approximately 5,000 years old and the oldest tree from the UK is about 1,000 . The four main parts of a tree are the roots,
            the trunk, the branches, and the leaves. The roots of a tree are usually under the ground. However, this is not always true. The roots of the mangrove tree are often under water or on the sides of cliffs. A single tree has many roots. The
            roots carry nutrients and water from the ground through the trunk and branches to the leaves of the tree. They can also breathe in air.[1] Sometimes, roots are specialized into aerial roots, which can also provide support, as is the case with
            the banyan tree.

            <h5>About Globle Warming</h5>
            <p class="globle">
                life sustains on Earth by depending on the energy coming from the sun. About 60 percent of the energy and light reaching the Earth surface passes through the air and vapors where the harmful gases get segregated and absorbed. These gases are radiated
                upwards in the form of infrared radiation. About 90-92 percent of this infrared radiation is then received by the greenhouse gases and reflected back to the earth’s surface. Due to the ozone layer depletion and global warming, the greenhouse
                effect has become the primary reason for which the Earth surface now radiates more heat than it usually should. Our planet contains many gases which form a surface layer and prevent unwanted radiations to reach the surface. These gases
                are in certain proportions breaking which, the components get disturbed.
                <b>The greenhouse gas</b> absorbs and emits these radiations within the range which ultimately causes the greenhouse effect. The common greenhouse gases found in Earth’s atmosphere are:

        <h5>Consequences of Global warming</h5>
        Warmer climate: On average,the Earth’s temperature will become warmer than earlier, while some places will get warm while others may not. The rise of sea level: Due to global warming, the glaciers and ice sheets of Greenland and Atlantic will melt which
        will add water to the sea level, thus causing many disasters like Tsunami. A rise in sea level will also have an economic impact especially on the low-lying coastal areas and islands causing unavoidable soil erosion. Agricultural impact: According
        to multiple experiments, with the high concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere, the growth of crops is twice than the normal growth. At the same time, the shifting of the climatic pattern may change the areas where crop production becomes faster
        and better thus affecting the normal amount of agriculture.

            are just over 3 trillion mature trees in the world.[1] A tree typically has many secondary branches supported clear of the ground by the trunk. This trunk typically contains woody tissue for strength, and vascular tissue to carry materials
            from one part of the tree to another. For most trees it is surrounded by a layer of bark which serves as a protective barrier. Below the ground, the roots branch and spread out widely; they serve to anchor the tree and extract moisture and
            nutrients from the soil. Above ground, the branches divide into smaller branches and shoots. The shoots typically bear leaves, which capture light energy and convert it into sugars by photosynthesis, providing the food for the tree's growth
            and development. Trees usually reproduce using seeds. Flowers and fruit may be present, but some trees, such as conifers, instead have pollen cones and seed cones. Palms, bananas, and bamboos also produce seeds, but tree ferns produce spores
            instead. trees have always been revered, with sacred groves in various cultures, and they play a role in many of the world's mythologies.</h2>
